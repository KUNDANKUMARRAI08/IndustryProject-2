1. Functions of Data Link Layer 
● Provides a reliable link between two nodes.
● Detects and corrects errors in data transmission.
● Manages the flow of data between two nodes.
● Provides addressing for data frames.
● Encapsulates data frames for transmission over the physical layer.
The Data Link Layer is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently 
between two nodes on a network. It does this by performing the following functions: 
● Error detection and correction: The Data Link Layer uses a variety of techniques to detect 
and correct errors in data transmission. These techniques include checksums, cyclic 
redundancy checks (CRCs), and forward error correction (FEC).
● Flow control: The Data Link Layer manages the flow of data between two nodes to prevent 
one node from overwhelming the other. This is done by using a variety of techniques, such 
as windowing and sliding windows.
● Addressing: The Data Link Layer provides addressing for data frames. This allows each 
node on a network to uniquely identify each other.
● Encapsulation: The Data Link Layer encapsulates data frames for transmission over the 
physical layer. This process involves adding a header and footer to the data frame. The 
header contains information about the data frame, such as the source and destination 
addresses, the frame length, and the error detection code. The footer contains information 
about the end of the frame.
